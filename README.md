# Project Overview

## Breweries

The name of your project with deployed URL.

## Project Description

My final project will be able to provide the user with breweries based on the user's location. The user will specify if they want to look by city, name, zip code, distance, state, or type. 


## API and Data Sample

I'm using a brewery API. It includes all of the data that I need and it's completely free. The downside of the API is that it does not include images of the breweries.
